# CodersCave_Internship-DS

In the CodersCave Internship Program, I was assigned five tasks that required me to utilize my IT skills such as Python programming, machine learning, data analysis, and data visualization. This repository contains all the work I have completed during my time at CodersCave.

The Normal tasks included in this internship are:

1. Exploratory Data Analysis - Terrorism
2. Email Spam Detection

I have documented my progress and uploaded all the relevant files for each task in this repository.
